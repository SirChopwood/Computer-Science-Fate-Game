  "Desc": "A serial-killer whose name is known all over the world. In Japan, it is often designated as \"Jack the Ripper\" without change. In spite of the frantic investigations of the Scotland Yard, it butchered five women and then disappeared without ever getting caught. Because the true identity of Jack the Ripper has never been made clear, its shape changes in accordance with which Class it is summoned into. In this case, having manifested as an Assassin, it is an aggregation of children who were not allowed to be born. Because of this, Assassin-Jack was killed before even being born, her wish for the Holy Grail is a regression to the womb--to return to her mother's womb. Although ignorant of the ways of the world, maybe due to having been summoned as Jack the Ripper, she is frighteningly quick-witted. ",
